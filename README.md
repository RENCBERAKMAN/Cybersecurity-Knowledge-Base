## 🌐 BILINGUAL METHODOLOGY (EN/TR)
This repository adopts a **Hybrid Linguistic Framework** to bridge the gap between global standards and deep conceptual understanding:

* **Technical Terminology (English):** All industry-standard terms, command-line parameters, and professional jargon are kept in English to ensure alignment with global cybersecurity standards.
* **Contextual Logic (Turkish):** Deep-dive explanations, logic flow, and personal "Aha!" moments are documented in Turkish to solidify conceptual mastery.

## 🛠️ OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW
To maximize the utility of this Knowledge Base:
1.  **Navigate** to the specific domain via the directory table above.
2.  **Review** the `README.md` within the folder for theoretical frameworks and attack vectors.
3.  **Execute** using the `Cheatsheet.md` or specialized notes for rapid command-line reference.
